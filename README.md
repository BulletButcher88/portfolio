**MISSION STATEMENT**

This is a portfolio website, for the purpose of presenting future website and prevous skills and works. I wanted a site that was more about images than text. And I hope to eventually bring across most of my content of my old WIX.com site: www.bulletbutcher.com

I aim to have an interactive page that I aim to keep as a play ground for interactive art, as I develop my coding skills.

The goal of the site is to challange the user, and spark the imagnation.

I am inspired by two tv series Black Mirror and Love, Death and Robots. I set to try create a platform in a simular style, adding to it my creative artistic style.

**Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)**



January 1, 1983 the official birth of the Internet

The National Science Foundation in the early 1980s set to make a national supercomputer to help several universities and managed to provide an interconnective operation in 1986 with NSFNET. By mid-1980, NSF, NASA and the US government had formed a larger network and by 1990, the platform had fewer restrictions that allowed commercial traffic to start using it.

Between 1984 and 1988 CERN began installation and operation of TCP/IP to interconnect its major internal computer systems, workstations. Tim Berners-Lee showed that hypertext documents could be processed by any node on the network, and from his research at CERN, started to pave the way for the World Wide Web. 

The Mosaic web browser in 1993 was created by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) with was the first to show text and other graphics to the user. 

In summary, the internet was more intended for an internal information platform, started as obscure research, but now is used worldwide with 3.2billion people using it.


**Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)**

When we type an address into our browser, the browser locates the files by connecting to DNS (domain name service) and looks up the ip address for that url. The DNS is filing numbers and once the ip address is found, the browser attempts to connect to the web server.

Once the browser connects to the server have an open connection it makes a request to the article on ESPN. In order for the request to be sent, it needs to must be formatted to TCP/IP and the HTTP protocol that is a group of addresses within one. 

Once there is a connection to the web server, it looks up all the specific articles, receives all the data and files and chops them into data packages to send back to your browser. 


The data package will be HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files for your browser to then process and appear on the screen


**Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)**

There has been some fantastic leaps in world development, due to the growth of the World-Wide-Web. Especially in terms of multinational expansion and online social infrastructure. People are able to now work remotely just by a laptop and a connection to the internet.

Most of this has to be praised to the radical concept of open-source codes, platforms, and the deregulation of the technology. 

However, not every country is happy. China has setup its own internet and Russia lawmakers are seeking to create a 'sovereign' network, like China network, aiming to shut itself off from the World Wide Web. In 2013 Russian web-based language became the second most popular language used on the web, 76% of Russian use it.

In a fast-moving world, it will be very interesting to see how these more controlling online platforms will survive
